# Hello and Welcome to Miss Fatale

**My name is Amber aka Miss Fatale, I'm a tech enthusiast from The Netherlands.**

I am a dedicated IT enthusiast with a strong passion for educating individuals who share the similar interests. My objective is to provide knowledge and guidance to IT professionals and Homelab enthusiasts on a wide range of topics, including DevOps, Software Engineering, Network Engineering, and much more.

## Join my Community 
I think the most effective way to gain knowledge about tech is by establishing connections with individuals who share similar interests and working together through collaboration. With this in mind, I have created my own Discord server, serving as a platform where like-minded individuals can connect, learn, and exchange their enthusiasm for tech.
*Please note that my Discord server encompasses a variety of subjects. To access the tech channels, please assign yourself the tech role.*

## Support
Creating educational content without charge can be a time-consuming challenge. By making financial contributions, I can dedicate more time and effort towards creating educational materials. My aim is for this GitHub page to serve as a comprehensive knowledge repository for anyone and everyone. Therefore, contributions to this GitHub page are greatly appreciated.

Please note that supporting me is entirely optional. My YouTube videos, resources, and knowledge repositories are accessible to everyone. Of course, you will receive some notable benefits and rewards in return.
