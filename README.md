# Hello and Welcome to Miss Fatale

**My name is Amber aka Miss Fatale, I'm a tech enthusiast from The Netherlands.**

I'm an incredibly passionate IT ethusiast and love to educate like-minded individuals. The goal is to educate IT Professionals and Homelab enthusiasts about many different industry techniques such as: Devops, Software Engineering, Network Engineering and much more. 

*I wouldn't consider myself an IT professional but simply an enthusiast sharing her knowledge.*

## Join my Community 
I believe the best way to educate yourself about tech is by connecting yourself with like-minded individuals and collaboration. So to encourage that I opened my own Discord. It's a place to connect, learn and share your passion with others.
*Take note that my Discord server has multiple subjects. You can find the tech channels by giving yourself the tech role.*
